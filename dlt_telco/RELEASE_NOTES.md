# Release Notes

## Telco CDR Data Processing Platform - Initial Release

This release establishes the foundation for a scalable Telco CDR (Call Detail Record) data processing platform using Databricks Delta Live Tables (DLT). The platform consists of two main components: a data generator for producing synthetic CDR data and a DLT pipeline for ingesting and processing this data.

### Data Generator (src/cdr/data_generator)

**Version: 1.0.0**

The data generator component provides tools for creating realistic synthetic telecom data for development and testing purposes.

#### Features:
- **User Profile Generation**: Creates synthetic user profiles with realistic telecom attributes:
  - User identifiers (user_id, MSISDN, IMSI, IMEI)
  - Plan details (plan_name, data_limit_gb, voice_minutes, sms_count)
  - Registration information and location data
  - Configurable number of users (default: 1000)

- **Multi-CDR Type Generation**: Produces five distinct CDR types:
  - Voice CDRs: Traditional call records with duration and call parties
  - Data CDRs: Mobile data usage records with uplink/downlink volumes
  - SMS CDRs: Text message records with sender/receiver information
  - VoIP CDRs: Voice over IP call records
  - IMS CDRs: IP Multimedia Subsystem session records

- **Kafka Integration**: Direct streaming of generated data to Kafka topics:
  - Dedicated topics for each CDR type (telco-voice-cdrs, telco-data-cdrs, etc.)
  - User profiles topic (telco-users)
  - Configurable message production rate
  - SASL/SSL authentication support for secure Kafka connections

- **Data Consistency**: Ensures referential integrity between users and CDRs:
  - All CDRs reference valid user IDs from the generated user pool
  - Consistent user attributes across all data types
  - Persistent user storage via JSON files for reproducible data generation

#### Usage:
- Generate and export user profiles to Kafka
- Stream continuous CDR data to Kafka topics
- Customize data generation parameters (user count, message rate, etc.)
- Generate data files locally for offline testing

### DLT Pipeline (dlt_telco)

**Version: 1.0.0**

The Delta Live Tables pipeline component provides a structured, reliable way to ingest and process streaming CDR data.

#### Features:
- **Bronze Layer Implementation**: Initial data ingestion layer with minimal transformation:
  - Raw data preservation with original Kafka metadata
  - Standardized schema and table properties
  - Processing timestamp addition for data lineage

- **Multi-CDR Type Support**: Separate bronze tables for each CDR type:
  - Voice CDRs (bronze_voice_cdrs)
  - Data CDRs (bronze_data_cdrs)
  - SMS CDRs (bronze_sms_cdrs)
  - VoIP CDRs (bronze_voip_cdrs)
  - IMS CDRs (bronze_ims_cdrs)

- **Multiplexed Table**: Consolidated view of all CDR types (bronze_all_cdrs)

- **User Profile Ingestion**: Dedicated table for user data (bronze_users)
  - JSON parsing of user attributes
  - Schema enforcement for downstream processing

- **Secure Credential Management**: Integration with Databricks secrets for Kafka authentication

- **Deployment Automation**: Databricks Asset Bundle configuration for CI/CD:
  - Development and production deployment targets
  - Serverless compute configuration
  - Catalog and schema organization

#### Technical Implementation:
- Streaming ingestion from Kafka using structured streaming
- Delta Lake table format for ACID transactions and time travel
- Modular code structure with helper functions for maintainability
- Dynamic table creation for different CDR types

### Next Steps

Future releases will focus on:

1. **Silver Layer Implementation**: Data validation, cleansing, and enrichment
2. **Gold Layer Implementation**: Business-level aggregations and metrics
3. **Data Quality Enforcement**: Expectations and quality monitoring
4. **Advanced Analytics**: ML-ready features and anomaly detection
5. **Dashboard Integration**: Real-time KPI visualization

### Known Limitations

- Bronze layer only - no data validation or enrichment yet
- Limited error handling for malformed messages
- No schema evolution handling
- Basic deployment configuration without monitoring or alerting
